	<h2>Humans &amp; Automation - Blog Post 1</h2>
	<h3>by Sarveshwar</h3>
	<img src="./Tech Blog_files/9690512888_21c788d37a_b.jpg">
	<p>The video "Humans Need not Apply" highlights the fact that robots and automation are currently taking over the workforce and will inevitably eliminate jobs for humans in the near future. It goes over the various types of jobs and how robots are currently filling those positions and some of the things that they can even do better than humans. They can operate cars that can drive for hours on end, search through papers, do everyday tasks and much more. Thus eliminating the need for human and manual labor. It even goes into the creative field with robots now being able to create pieces of music and playing them with various instruments. The music sounding very close to what a human can create. The video is very informing and brings awareness to people about something that will have a profound impact in the coming years.</p>
	<p>In my opinion, I feel that automation is not that good for present day society. It will cause millions to become unemployed just because a robot was created to perform a job at a lower cost. Many people will be affected however it won't be applicable to all. Some people in the entertainment industry or law field will still be able to retain their jobs due to the required human interaction for each. Hopefully robots in the future won't be as prominent to the point where humans need not apply. </p>

	<h4>I agree, robots are going to take all our jobs. I think at some point, robots will be able to have human like programs, causing them to do ALL jobs.  </h4>

	<h2>Blown to Bits - Blog Post 2</h2>
    <h3>by Sarveshwar</h3>
	<img src="./Tech Blog_files/34662365266_ed166a92bd_b.jpg">
	<p>The first section I read of blown to bits was called "Footprints &amp; Fingerprints" and is about the digital footprint. Everytime we do something on the internet, it is logged and kept somewhere. Just like in real life, when we touch something, it leaves our physical fingerprint. The same thing applies to the internet, just digital.</p>
	<p>The second section I read of blown to bits is called "Smile while we Snap" and is about the fact that there are cameras all over the world that are linked to the internet. Thus most of us have been recorded onto the internet.</p>
	<p>The third section I read of blown to bits is called "Knowing where you are" and is about the GPS system. It talks about how when a GPS is attached onto a vehicle or taken with us, we can be tracked anywhere. Many mountain climbers carry these items in case of any dire situations.</p>
	<p>In my opinion I feel that technology is improving very quickly and some parts of it can benefit the current generation and some parts can negatively affect it. Our privacy can be invaded with the "Knowing where you are" and "Smile while we Snap" articles as the affects of both can track where we are. </p>

	<h2>A quick question...</h2>
	<h3>Emilie Aviles</h3>
	<h4>What do you think is the worst thing that can happen with the rapid improvement of technology besides being able to track our location more easily?</h4>
